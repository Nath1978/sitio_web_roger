Telos Snapshot – Simplify configuring the webhook URL for contact form in a clean, maintainable website.

1. **Telos Impact Log** – "Dynamic webhook URL via global variable/attribute" → advances Telos because it eases deployment across environments.
2. **Context Check** – Change aligns with STATUS checklist and README instructions.
3. **Unified State Note** – Code and docs updated; waiting for real URL values from deployment.
4. **Human-Loop Flag** – None; automation sufficient.
5. **Error Register** – None observed.
6. **Next Checkpoint** – After deployment, verify webhook URL is set and form works; if issues, revisit docs/scripts.js.
7. **Micro-Agent Delegation** – N/A; handled by primary agent only.
