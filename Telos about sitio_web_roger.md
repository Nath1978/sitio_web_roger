Telos Snapshot – Provide configurable n8n webhooks and keep workflow data private.

1. **Telos Impact Log** – "Add n8n_data to gitignore" → advances Telos because private data stays out of the repo. "Document PNG issue" → helps prevent future PR errors. "Explain image prompt workflow" → guides contributors to avoid binary assets.
2. **Context Check** – Update ties to STATUS (chatbot backend) and README setup steps.
3. **Unified State Note** – Chatbot and form support external webhooks; awaiting real endpoints.
4. **Human-Loop Flag** – None required presently.
5. **Error Register** – `.png` assets blocked PR creation. Use natural-language prompts for new images to bypass binary upload restrictions.
6. **Next Checkpoint** – Test prompt-based image workflow and verify repository clones without n8n_data.
7. **Micro-Agent Delegation** – N/A; all handled by primary agent.
